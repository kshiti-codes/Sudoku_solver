# Sudoku_solver



## Explanation
1. Main Method:

Initializes the Sudoku board.
Calls the solveSudoku method to solve the puzzle.
Prints the solved board if a solution is found.
solveSudoku Method:

2. Iterates over each cell in the board.
Tries placing numbers 1 to 9 in each empty cell.
Uses the isValid method to check if the placement is valid.
Recursively calls itself to solve the next cell.
Backtracks if placing the current number doesn't lead to a solution.

3. isValid Method:

Checks if placing a number in a specific cell violates Sudoku rules (row, column, and 3x3 subgrid).

4. printBoard Method:

Prints the Sudoku board in a readable format.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the backtracking approach for solving a Sudoku puzzle is quite high due to the exhaustive search it performs.

1. Worst Case:
   
In the worst case, the algorithm explores all possible configurations of the board, which is O(9^(N^2)), where N is the size of the board (9 for a standard Sudoku puzzle).
This comes from the fact that each cell can have 9 possible values, and there are N^2 cells in total.

2. Average Case:
   
The average case is hard to define due to the nature of the problem and depends on the initial number of filled cells and their positions.
Practical performance is usually much better than the worst case due to the early termination provided by backtracking when invalid placements are detected early.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is mainly due to the recursion stack used in the backtracking process.

1. Space Complexity:
   
The depth of the recursion tree can go up to N^2 in the worst case.
Thus, the space complexity is O(N^2), which, for a standard Sudoku puzzle, simplifies to O(81) (or simply O(1) since 81 is a constant).
